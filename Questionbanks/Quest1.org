HINT: Always give types before functions\\
      When writing Inductive definitions, clarify the hypothesis
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
*   Write an inductive gofer function nth to find the nth element of a list
#+BEGIN_SOURCE 
  ? nth. 5. [1,2,3,4,5] 
   5
#+END_SOURCE

* 
  Write a gofer function to find the inner product of two vectors where each vector is represented as a [Int]
* 
  Write a gofer function *tk* that returns the first n elements of a list
#+BEGIN_SOURCE
  ? tk. 2. [1...10]
   [1,2]
#+END_SOURCE
* 
  Give a gofer definition for a function that computes pythagorean triples
  Pythagorean triples satisfy \
  x² + y² = z²
* 
  Define a function gcd that takes two Int arguments and computes their gcd
